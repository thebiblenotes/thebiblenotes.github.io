            <h1>The Purpose of God (Ephesians 1:3-14)</h1>
<p>Why does God exist? I think such question is very important for us to understand, for at least a reason: If God is indeed the creator of the universe, that includes us and the world where we live in, then knowing his purpose will not only enable us to understand why we too exist, but it will also enable us to fulfil our purpose as God has intended. Such question would not be answered had God himself not reveal his purpose to us. Indeed, by his grace he has revealed it through his word as recorded in the Scripture. And one of the places in the Scripture where God’s purpose is clearly revealed is in Ephesians 1:3-14, as in the following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>3</sup> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, <sup>4</sup> even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love <sup>5</sup> he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, <sup>6</sup> to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. <sup>7</sup> In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, <sup>8</sup> which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight <sup>9</sup> making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ <sup>10</sup> as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth. <sup>11</sup> In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, <sup>12</sup> so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory. <sup>13</sup> In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ephesians 1:3-14 is actually one single sentence of 202 words, in the Greek language where it was originally written. There, God’s plan is laid before us, presented as a grand sweep from before the foundation of the world until the fullness of time, culminating in every single thing being united in Christ. A plan in which the focus is clearly the praise of God for his blessing (verses 6, 12, 14), as can be clearly perceived from the beginning and the end of this passage (verses 3, 14).</p>

<p>This plan is carried out by God making a people for himself. A people whom he would give every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in order that they should be holy and blameless before him (verses 3-4). And this plan is realised by firstly choosing them before the creation of the universe (verse 4), and by God predestining his people for adoption as his children (verse 5). And ultimately, this plan is achieved by Jesus’ blood (verse 7). It is by Jesus’ blood that God’s people have redemption and forgiveness, and therefore be holy and blameless before God. And this plan is no longer unknown, but has now been disclosed, that is, to bring all things in heaven and on earth under one head, who is Christ (verses 9-10). And in this plan, the Jews (referred to as ‘we’ in verses 11-12) and the Gentiles (referred to as ‘you’ in verse 13) are brought together (referred to as ‘us’ in verse 14) in Christ. As such, there is now a new people with a new inheritance, with the Spirit as the guarantor. These are all the spiritual blessings that together form the plan, or the purpose, of God, as may be summarised in the following figure:</p>

<p>Notice also the sphere in which these blessings is experienced and enjoyed is in Christ. This phrase ‘in Christ’ or its equivalent appears more than 10 times throughout the passage and signifies that this purpose of God is indeed what it means to be in Christ. Moreover, these blessings are also experienced and enjoyed in another sphere referred to as ‘in the heavenly realms’. This expression is exclusive to the book of Ephesians and appears five times within it. A quick survey of the verses that contain the expression is shown in the following table:</p>

<p>It is quite surprising that the evil principalities and powers are there in the heavenly realms too. Peter T. O’Brien wrote in regard to this expression as follows (The Letter To The Ephesians, PNTC, page 97),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behind the expression, which stands within an Old Testament and Jewish rather than a Gnostic tradition, there is the notion of several ‘heavens’ (cf. 4:10). Christ has ascended above all the heavens (4:10) and sits at God’s right hand in the heavenly places ‘far above all rule and authority’. The principalities and powers are located in the lower heavens, in the realm of the air (cf. 2:2), in the darkness of this world (6:12). However, in the heavenly realms is not describing some celestial topography, for the sense conveyed by the local imagery is metaphorical rather than literal. In the heavenly realms is bound up with the divine saving events and is to be understood within a Pauline eschatological perspective. In line with the Jewish two-age structure heaven is seen from the perspective of the age to come, which has now been inaugurated by the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. At the same time, it is still part of this present evil age until the final consummation, for hostile powers are currently active in the heavenly realms (cf. 3:10; 6:12). The blessings of salvation which believers have received from God link them with the heavenly realms. These gracious gifts are not simply future benefits but are a present reality for us, since they have already been won for us by God’s saving action in Christ. As the following verses make plain, these blessings are integrally related to the whole course of salvation history and have been applied to believers by the Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The elaborated two-age structure is consistent with the mention of the earthly realm in verse 10. The earthly realm is the place in which we now live (see also 3:15; 4:9; 6:3), and now in verse 10 God’s purpose is bringing together both the heavenly and the earthly so that at the end all things are united under Jesus Christ. Therefore God’s purpose, which is to be enjoyed in the heavenly realms and consummated fully in the future, have begun already in the present earthly realm, as he is making a new people, Jews and Gentiles together, through the good news of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>This passage has therefore several implications from human perspective:</p>

<ol>
  <li>God’s people are not those who choose to become a part of the people, but it is all from God’s intention even from before the world was created.</li>
  <li>God’s people relate to God as children, not out of duty.</li>
  <li>God’s people are those who do not depend on themselves for forgiveness of sins but on Jesus’ blood.</li>
  <li>God’s people are a picture of what God is doing in eternity, a picture of the future which can be experienced now in part.</li>
  <li>God’s people are part of a glorious, future inheritance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a challenge for us to ponder: How might knowing this purpose of God affect your future? Where do you see yourself in eternity?</p>
